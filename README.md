"Build a Temperature Conversion Program"

Definition : Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For example, if the user enters a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program should convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.

Overview: This project is a Temperature Conversion Program developed in Python, designed to convert temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to input values and view converted results.

Features

User-Friendly Interface:
Developed using Tkinter to provide an intuitive and responsive GUI.
Users can easily input temperature values and select the unit of measurement.
Accurate Conversions:
Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with precision.
Instantaneous results displayed in all three temperature scales.
Input Validation and Error Handling:
Validates user inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
Provides informative feedback for incorrect inputs, enhancing user experience. ** Technologies Used**
Python:
Core programming language used for the application logic.
Tkinter:
Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the user interface.
How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:
 git clone https://github.com/utsavvachhani/temperature-conversion-program.git
cd temperature-conversion-program

2. Run the Program:
    python temperature_converter.py
3. Use the Interface:
Add support for additional temperature scales.
Implement advanced error handling and edge case management.
Enhance the GUI with more interactive elements and improved aesthetics.
